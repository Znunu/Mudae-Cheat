## Installation
Download the files in this repo. Download the [EzMudae.py](https://github.com/Znunu/EzMudae/blob/master/EzMudae.py) file and place it in the root with the rest of the files

Choose one:
### Basic bot or user bot
Edit main.py to include your prefix and token (instructions are in the file). Run main.py

### Advanced bot
If you're trying to make someone else add your bot, it makes sense to add some other commands to make it seem legit.
You can simply add cog.py and EzMudae.py to any other python bot and load the cog in cog.py.
I can recommend red bot if you don't already have a bot.
Feel free to create an issue if you need help or something doesn't work.

## Customization
The cog has very little code since most of the work is done by EzMudae.py.
It's therefore very easy to customize the bot.
You can for example change the alert or, if you're using it as selfbot, even automatically claim waifus
